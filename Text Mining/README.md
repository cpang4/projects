This project uses tidyverse and stringr packages to parse presidential speeches from 1790 â€“ 2012 and creates a data frame with:     
   
-president name   
-year   
-month      
-day (of the week)    
-number of sentences  
-number of words  

for each speech.   

You can find text file with the speech data, the R code, and the HTML doc that runs the R code and shows the results in this folder.
